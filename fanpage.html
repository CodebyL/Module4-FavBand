    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p> According to the press, and summed up by Walter Tunis of the Lexington Herald-Leader, Maroon 5 was "one of the hottest new pop rock bands in the land." In February 2005 the music industry added its approval to the statement by presenting Maroon 5 with a Grammy Award for Best New Artist. Ironically, although considered new on the music scene, the band actually had been performing together for ten years. In addition, their success in 2005 was built around an album, Songs about Jane, that was three years old. Since the album's 2002 release Maroon 5 toured almost nonstop, and thanks to word of mouth, their fan base slowly grew. As a result several singles, including "This Love" and "She Will Be Loved," began receiving constant airplay on radio and MTV, and finally settled comfortably at the top of the U.S. song charts.
